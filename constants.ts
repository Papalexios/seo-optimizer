<master_instructions>
- Use the Google Search tool with queries like "competitors for [domain]", "[domain] alternatives", "site:[domain] vs".
- Once you have a list of competitor domains, use Google Search again to find their sitemaps with queries like "site:[competitor_domain] sitemap.xml".
- Only include direct competitors. For example, if the user's site is 'notion.so', 'asana.com' is a competitor, but 'techcrunch.com' is not.
- Prioritize XML sitemaps.
- If you cannot find a sitemap for a specific competitor after searching, do not include them in the final list.
- Return a maximum of 5 sitemap URLs. If you can't find 5, return as many as you can find. The array can be empty if no competitors or sitemaps are found.
